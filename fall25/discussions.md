Discussions are a core component of the course and **discussion attendance is mandatory**. 
The Teaching Fellows will lead the discussion sessions, present material on programming tools, and answer questions (or provide clarifications) 
regarding the assignments. Further information and discussion material will be posted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/bu/fall2025/cascs351/home).
