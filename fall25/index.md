## Overview
CS 351 fundamental concepts of distributed computing (logical clocks, causal order, snapshots, consensus, atomic commit), communication and synchronization primitives, concurrency control, 
task and data parallelism, data consistency, replication, and fault tolerance.

Specifically, we will cover the following topics:
- Processes, communication, parallelism (communication primitives, RPCs, concurrency, MapReduce).
- Synchronization and Fault tolerance (time, clocks, vector clocks, failure detection, failure models, recovery, distributed snapshots).
- Replication and consensus (RAFT).
- Transactions and consistency (consistency models, atomicity, 2PC, snapshot isolation).

## Prerequisites
**CAS CS 210**.

**NOTE: CASCS 350 and CASCS 351 fulfill the same major requirement (“take two of the 3 courses in CS 320, CS 332, CS 350”). Students are allowed to take both CS 350 and CS 351 for credit. In this case one of the two will be applied towards electives in the major.**

## Grading scheme
TBD
